# Wellspring

This is a fork from [Wellspring project](https://github.com/pch/wellspring). Wellspring is a flexible CMS engine for Rails apps. You can use it to create any type of content website (blogs, magazines, portfolios etc.).

This is the source code for my tutorial: [How to Build a CMS in Ruby on Rails](http://pchm.co/tutorial-how-to-build-a-cms-in-ruby-on-rails/).

Use this as a gem in your Rails app and you will get a blog with user authentication and supports markdown syntax editing and displaying in the frontend.

## Getting Started

Best way to get started is to take a look at the [example blog app](https://github.com/pch/wellspring-example-blog).
